        </h3>
      </div>
      <ContentSection title="What is a runbook and what is it used for?">
        A runbook is a documented set of instructions and guidelines that outline step-by-step
        procedures for performing operational tasks in a consistent and efficient manner. It serves
        as a comprehensive guide for handling various scenarios, such as software deployments,
        system configurations, incident response, and routine maintenance. Runbooks provide software
        developers and operational teams with a standardized approach to execute tasks, ensuring
        consistency, reducing errors, and enabling automation. They serve as a valuable resource for
        knowledge transfer, onboarding new team members, promoting collaboration, and improving
        overall operational efficiency in software development processes.
      </ContentSection>
      <ContentSection title="The many different types of runbooks">
        Runbooks can vary in complexity depending on the nature of the operational tasks they cover.
        Here are different types of runbooks available, ranging from simple to complex:
        <br />

      <ContentSection title="Managing and storing runbooks">
        Software developers store their runbook documents in various locations depending on the
        specific needs and preferences of their organization. Some common storage options for
        runbook documents include:
        <br /> <br />
        <ol className="space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Document Management Systems:</span> Centralized storage
            for runbook documents with version control and collaboration features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Source Control Repositories:</span> Runbook documents
            stored alongside source code in version control repositories like Git.
          </li>
