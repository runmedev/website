      <ContentSection title="What is CI/CD?">
        <p>
          Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are development practices that
          enable developers to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably, improving software
          quality and speed of delivery. They are core elements of modern Agile and DevOps
          practices.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul className="space-y-1 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Continuous Integration (CI):</span> Developers
            frequently merge code changes into a central repository. These merges are automatically
            tested to catch and rectify errors swiftly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Continuous Deployment (CD):</span> Code changes that
            pass the CI phase are automatically deployed to the production environment, making the
            updated software available to users quickly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          There are also some systems that use a step in between these two stages, known as
          Continuous Delivery. In Continuous Delivery, code changes are automatically tested and
          prepared for a release to production. However, an explicit action (usually a manual
          approval) is required to push the changes to production. This offers a bit more control to
          ensure that nothing goes live without a final check.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          By integrating and deploying frequently, you can address bugs and add features more
          rapidly, improving your software and meeting your customers' needs more effectively. CI/CD
          also requires a solid suite of test cases since automated tests will be run every time
          changes are integrated, ensuring that software doesn't reach users until it has been
          verified to function as expected.

        <p>
          Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are key practices in modern
          software development, especially in environments that follow Agile, DevOps, or similar
          methodologies. Here are some of the major benefits of these practices for software
          developers:

          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Better Code Quality:</span> CI leads to more robust code
            by enabling frequent integrations and testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold">Rapid Issue Identification and Resolution:</span>{" "}

        <p>
          By adopting CI/CD practices, teams can significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and
          reliability of their software development process. It is also worth noting that successful
          implementation of these practices often requires a supportive culture and environment,
          where experimentation, learning, and open communication are encouraged.
