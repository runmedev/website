Tired of copying secrets into GitHub/Gitlab every other day? Chasing down correct values for newly introduced ENV vars after git pull? Today, we are making these problems go away. Don't believe me? Read on.

Introducing the ü¶â Owl Store, a concrete implementation of a Type System for Environment Variables that specifies, resolves, and verifies your environment's correctness.

## Let's Start With A Demo

The demo is a **Poor Sebastian‚Äôs Vercel** to generate preview URLs for Runme's documentation. Here is what it does:

- A Dagger module that leverages the Docusaurus build
- To generate production-ready Nginx container image with the docs
- Pushes the image to GCP‚Äôs artifact registry
- Launches a Google Cloud Run instance and returns the Preview URL
- Transparently uses the Owl Store to resolve the services accounts to auth the GCP operations

Check out this video:

    <source src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a1.jpg" type="video/mp4" />
</VideoWithCaption>

You can run it yourself at home. It's self-contained using Dagger and requires minimal setup and a GCP account. It‚Äôs available inside Runme‚Äôs [docs repo](https://github.com/stateful/docs.runme.dev). All steps to get it up and running are documented in [README.md](https://github.com/stateful/docs.runme.dev/blob/main/dagger/README.md), which is itself a Runme notebook. Be sure to switch to Runme's [pre-release](https://docs.runme.dev/installation/vscode#bleeding-edge-features); otherwise, you won't see the `Env Store` panel.

Now, let's get into the details.

## Why is this hard?

Getting environments ‚Äúright‚Äù is no easy feat. Ask your developer: Docker, lock files, pipelines, and the elasticity of cloud computing resources have undoubtedly increased the reproducibility of environments across the software development lifecycle. Albeit with more tangible success in production(-like) environments. DevOps is all about the left shift; however, arguably, this shift is still miles apart from humans.

A tell-tale sign I often encounter when talking to engineers in the field is having separate engineers/teams owning `Platform Engineering` and `DevX`. The idea is to provide narrow `git push` interfaces to advance code out of development, which is resource-intensive enough to, at best, cover and support the critical path. It‚Äôs where uniformity of operational excellence ([12factor](https://12factor.net/)) clashes with developers‚Äô need for unconstrained creativity and experimentation.

## Crossing the Dev vs. Ops Chasm

I have been pondering why we have yet to overcome the proverbial Dev vs. Ops chasm for several years now. During my time at Smallstep, I learned hands-on how powerful PKI-based strong identity (humans & workloads via OAuth & Workload Identity) is to moving to zero-trust security models (e.g., via [mTLS](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls/) or [SSH certificates](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates/)) that liberate us from reliance on the of space-bound perimeters (Hi, VPCs!) to enforce secure computing in the cloud-native age.

<ImageWithCaption caption="ENV-edition of the Draw the Owl meme">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a2.jpg" alt="Draw the Owl meme" />
</ImageWithCaption>

I have come to the firm belief that Configuration and Secrets Management is what's holding us back. This is not because we haven‚Äôt made strides with Sealed Secrets, CloudKMS, Vault, and a slew of Cloud-certified Secret Managers that provide sophisticated ACLing mechanisms.

It‚Äôs because we create JIRA tickets to generate, copy, and paste credentials to resources into GitHub/Gitlab or‚Äîclose your üôà eyes and üôâ ears now‚Äîpaste them into Slack channels or Zoom chats. The available solutions aren‚Äôt rooted in strong cryptographic identity. They don't work the same for humans and workloads, which, if they did, would massively increase reproducibility and portability‚Äîunlocking Single Sign-On for Environments.

## GitHub/Gitlab: Take My Bargaining Chips

This isn‚Äôt just time-intensive and error-prone; it makes third parties like GitHub, Gitlab, etc., our system of record. That‚Äôs something they love: more usage and more vendor lock-in. What an excellent way to give up all our bargaining chips. And now, we still haven‚Äôt solved the problem for developers in their environments, which requires bespoke solutions or running clusters locally. We wind up with spotty ‚Äúproject onboarding instructions,‚Äù which leave us with the challenge of figuring out how to draw the rest of the owl on our own‚Äîevery time.

## Enter the Owl Store ü¶â

As a bourbon-drinking armchair Computer Scientist myself, I spent quite some time dreaming up a solution to switch into building it earnestly well over a year ago. While still experimental, it‚Äôs closer to a beta than an alpha. There is an immense amount of ground to cover, so delivering an end-to-end experience was more important to me than going deep on any particular part. There will be bugs!

<ImageWithCaption caption="The Owl's simple CLI to inspect stores">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a3.jpg" alt="The Owl's simple command line interface" />
</ImageWithCaption>

While the Owl Store is fully integrated into Runme‚Äôs DevOps notebooks (which works well for demos), it‚Äôs remarkably self-contained. Given enough interest, I would love to spin it out as a standalone project. It's got a rudimentary CLI interface, which even lets you source a session's ENV vars into a running terminal session:

<ImageWithCaption caption="Source the Owl store snapshot into a terminal session">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a4.jpg" alt="Source the contents of a store into a terminal session" />
</ImageWithCaption>

## A Complete Solution That's Unfinished

Please note that the Owl is a work in progress. While it illustrates a complete solution, it‚Äôs far from finished. Building it has helped unpack the series of unsolved problems along the way. The code is very pragmatic, prioritizing making it work and then making it right before making it concise/scaleable.

A warning: If you expect another ‚ÄúKubernetes API‚Äù, the Owl Store isn‚Äôt that. However, I‚Äôd love a Kubernetes Admission Controller that mounts secrets downstream. Get in touch. I have also looked at various technologies, including DirEnv, Nix, Infisical, Doppler Labs, Vault, Chezmoi, Teller, Cuelang, and Pulumi, all solving parts of the problem, to name a few. My main objection (applicable to end-to-end solutions) is that users have to adopt them wholesale, more often than not, handing over custody of their secrets and/or requiring SDKs that circumvent the treasured environment altogether.

## Blobs of KEY=VALUE Strings Running the World

Configuration and Secret Management are a ‚Äúdeath by papercuts‚Äù issue. It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust‚Äù secrets; it‚Äôs all of configuration. While secrets are exponentially more complex, they are still "configured". Nothing works if your configuration is wrong. This is why the Owl Store gets to the mother of all configuration management challenges: The **Correctness of Environment Variables**. Blobs of KEY=VALUE Strings are running the world!

<ImageWithCaption caption="Whoza self-hosted Supabase, so many vars">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a5.jpg" alt="Whoza Supabase" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Before debriefing the Owl‚Äôs implementation details, let's jump into an example. The goal is to paint a picture of how it works from a user‚Äôs perspective, using a sysadmin mindset and focusing on the Owl Store's visible parts that concern users.

## Good Luck Running a Monolith Locally

Below is Stateful's Git repository containing the monolith running our [Cloud product](https://stateful.com/). With many third-party API integrations, the amount of environment configuration is substantial. However, 57 environment variables are actually on the low end for a monolith.

## ‚ùå Invalid Environment

The Owl Store's UX clearly identifies how ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù my environment‚Äôs variables are.

<ImageWithCaption caption="The Owl's `Env Store` pane will display invalid variables first">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a6.jpg" alt="Invalid Environment" />
</ImageWithCaption>

More importantly, it does so securely, making me comfortable publishing screenshots. Concisely identifying the correctness gap in your environment variables is a tremendous boost in help.

<ImageWithCaption caption="The same 'Env Store' snapshot is available via the CLI">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a7.jpg" alt="CLI's view of the env store" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Even better, the Owl‚Äôs Env Store UI isn‚Äôt locked into a VS Code panel. Thanks to the Owl‚Äôs local-only APIs secured by mTLS, the same information is available on the CLI. Looking at this screenshot now, makes me want to color the invalid entries ‚ùå red. It's on the todo list.

## ‚úÖ Valid Environment

Now, if your keen eye detected the commented-out resolution path in the upper left editor (above screenshots), let‚Äôs return those lines, reset the session (the Owl is a fully managed ENV store), and notice the difference.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Specifying a resolution path for the Environment">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a8.jpg" alt="Specify a resolution path" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Magic üßô! Within seconds, there are no more unresolved ENV variables. The Owl Store now automatically resolved variables via GCP‚Äôs secret manager (see `[gcp:secrets]`) using my [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) (as in `auth: ADC`) in the `platform-staging-413816` project, which I previously put in place completing GCP‚Äôs OAuth flow. It does so quickly by applying simple transformations (see: `expr: [...] key | lower()`) to the variable keys.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Based on the resolution path, the Owl will resolve unresolved variables">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a9.jpg" alt="Valid Environment" />
</ImageWithCaption>

It'd be easy to add triggering GCP's OAuth flow if no valid user credentials are available and/or resolve any other prerequisites that aren't met. Here are a few things to understand. Frankly, GCP's Secret Manager is very much low-hanging fruit. We are using it internally, and it is demoing well. Outside of it, though, AWS, Vault, webhooks, etc., or chaining any of these is possible. There is a lot of ground to cover. However, all the same principles apply.

### Desired State: Description of Environment Variables

This example vastly simplifies The Owl Store‚Äôs capabilities for demonstration purposes. We chose to reuse `DotEnv` conventions to meet engineers where they are already.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Env Spec declarations leaned on commonplace .env.example or .env.sample">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a10.jpg" alt="ENV spec declarations leaned on .env.example" />
</ImageWithCaption>

The Owl will look for `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, or `.env.spec` in the code repository's root, which declares the variable‚Äôs keys, a description, and an env spec (aka type). This is a slight variation of how `.env.example` files are already being used, but the payoff is worth the while. We'll debrief this soon.

### Flexible Configuration Frontends

In this example, the Owl‚Äôs configuration uses a Custom-Resource-Definition-like configuration frontend we usually see in the Kubernetes-world. However, internally the Owl uses a graph representation independent of any configuration frontend. I built the CRDs in a few hours, and they are far from final. Declarative YAML seemed a sensible choice for this example. It would be possible to give Javascript folks a `package.json` way to do this, Rubyists a `DSL`, Golang folks a `TOML` file, or `SDKs` for any language platform to configure any aspect of the Owl Store. More on this further below.

### Multiple Resolution Paths & Mechanisms

In this example, outside of built-in `.env.` or `.env.local` resolution (non-sensitive config), the CRD-specified value as per `path` requires a hard-coded `project: platform-staging-413816`. However, with the capability of the ‚Äúrearrangeable‚Äù internal graph, it‚Äôs possible to have preceding nodes in the graph match a human or workload identity (e.g., GCP user or service-account) to a set of metadata, including `project`, which downstream is used to resolve secrets in GCP‚Äôs secret manager.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Specify a resolution path for the Owl; GCP Secrets in this case">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a11.jpg" alt="Specifying a resolution path" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Instead of specifying a single path, running multiple in parallel is possible, and either the one that succeeds first wins or overwrites the other in a defined sequence. It's also possible to consider configuration backends, not just secret managers. What do you need?

### Variable Visibility and Validation

Your keen eyes have probably already identified a crucial part of what makes the Owl Store work: **Spec Types**, e.g., `# Secret!` Every Variable acquires a type. Unless specified otherwise, it defaults to `Opaque`, which means it‚Äôs neither fully visible nor entirely hidden. One-click reveals the value in the UI. Other atomic spec types are `Secret`, `Password`, and `Plain`. When describing environment variables, you almost always focus on a small yet significant subset. And even without full coverage, secret keys in your shell profile are guarded sufficiently by defaulting to `Opaque`.

<ImageWithCaption caption="CRD-style Env Spec definition laying validation over visibility">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a12.jpg" alt="CRD-style Env Spec definition" />
</ImageWithCaption>

The Spec types `Secret` and `Password` are particular. Clear text values are never available in Owl's UI/UX. There is no API to expose them; they are intentionally masked, and the Owl makes no exceptions. Outside of the atomic spec types, it is possible to define custom types to layer validation on top of visibility for built-in security hygiene. More on that below.

### Lifecycle over Time

Another detail I wouldn‚Äôt want to be overlooked is the Owl Store's `Source` column. There is a reason why the Owl‚Äôs CLI command to inspect the session‚Äôs store is called `... store snapshot`: An Owl session‚Äôs internal graph stores the entire lifecycle of how a single variable is loaded, resolved, verified, mutated, removed, etc., over time.

<ImageWithCaption caption="The Owl store retains the entire lifecycle of variables, 'Source' shows the last recent mutation">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a13.jpg" alt="Lifecycle tracking of variables" />
</ImageWithCaption>

The store‚Äôs UI effectively nets a snapshot. The `Source` column in this UI shows the last recent mechanism that mutated a value. This capability is essential because, unlike workloads, humans are interactive. Occasionally, it makes sense to manually provide the last unresolved value, e.g., the "god password," for the master database.

### Interactive Resolution

For instance, a last-resort resolution could be to `prompt the user for input` when a variable remains unresolved. Runme does precisely that. When it happens, the Owl Store will retain that variable `$XYZ` was unresolved and transition to resolved when and by what mechanism. Moreover, if you ran `unset XYZ` in a Runme notebook cell, it would record a deletion.

Of course, if we'd run resolution for a workload, not a human, any variable's unresolved value would be considered an irrecoverable error and exit.

## Takeaways

Based on what‚Äôs covered in the example above, I will stipulate that Owl‚Äôs approach, with human ergonomics first, not just equips it with everything required to configure developer environments but workloads, e.g., CI/CD job, Services running in Kubernetes clusters, too. Running resolution for workloads is a vast simplification since "interactivity" in, e.g., a pipeline makes little sense. Of course, more development effort is required to expand Owl‚Äôs graph and integration capabilities to truly unlock this.

I will also claim that Owl‚Äôs principles should be extended further up and downstream, e.g., by providing SDKs that, in code, provide type safety while generating Env Spec type declarations instead of maintaining them by hand. Or, Admission Controllers and GitHub Actions that would enable fully reproducing environments anywhere using identity and, at most, an environment identifier, e.g., `team5-staging-us-central1`. This would make every developer's and operator's life much easier. Win-win!

We need a full-featured tooling ecosystem around ‚ÄúTyped Environments‚Äù. The Owl Store ü¶â is precisely that.

Let's look under the hood.

## Under the ü¶â Owl Store‚Äôs Hood

The Owl Store brings type safety to the 1970s concept of ENV Vars. Remember the skeptics who thought Javascript didn‚Äôt need Typescript? Fair enough; don‚Äôt use it. The Owl Store is very similar. The Owl in a nutshell:

- A smart Environment Store toolchain for humans **and** workloads
- Specify, validate, and resolve environment variables anchored in strong identity
- Built-in security hygiene to make the right things easy and the wrong things hard
- Formal verification of ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù and opening doors for better tooling ecosystem
- All without requiring remote servers, backend APIs, or taking custody of your secrets

We took inspiration from the SSH Agent and the type system behind Typescript, which brings gradual type safety to Javascript. Despite using it daily, for the longest time, I had no clue [how the SSH Agent worked](https://smallstep.com/blog/ssh-agent-explained/).

<ImageWithCaption caption="Local SSH Agent listing the loaded keys">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a14.jpg" alt="Local SSH Agent listing the loaded keys" />
</ImageWithCaption>

In the SSH Agent, once a private key is loaded, the only APIs available are signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting messages and signatures. Keys loaded in plain text can not be extracted as such; it's a one-way door. I can‚Äôt blame you if you don‚Äôt want to know how the SSH Agent works. It just does; you don‚Äôt have to. That‚Äôs the killer feature.

Skipping a pro/con discussion about strong typing, TypeScript's key feature that inspired us is its ability to be adopted gradually. In the Owl's case, any workload's focus is only ever on a subset of the most important environment variables. Use as much of it as you want‚Äîno more, no less.

### The Importance of Strong Identity

Anchoring Environments and their resolution on strong human/workload identity (OAuth, [workload identity federation](https://github.com/stateful/linkerd-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/dx.yml#L17-L22), etc.) allows us to decouple from third-party providers. Paired with containers, it makes switching public cloud resource providers (GitHub, AWS, GCP, etc) and/or secret backends (Vault, AWS/GCP Secret Manager, Cloud KMS, etc.) possible, enabling the Owl to stay out-of-band of secrets lifecycles. It unlocks free portability of both human and workload Environments (e.g. my laptop, a CDE in Codespaces, a CI/CD job, Kubernetes clusters running pods).

The closest comparable technology I've seen is [Pulumi's ESC](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/). However, it comes from an Infrastructure Management (IaC) angle and mandates Pulumi's proprietary backend. That's not bad per se; it's just different from the Owl Store's principles.

## Redefining the Relationship between Workload, Repo, and Environment

Looking at the ordinary lifecycle of any one ENV variable, they start existing by the sheer force of being used. Some programs, workloads/services, and scripts validate better and provide more documentation than others. However, when we are asked to provide values based on blank variable keys, it‚Äôs usually left up to the environment and its user. Either you copied the proper values into GitHub/Gitlab, specified them in a Kubernetes/Compose manifest, or had enough `-e KEY=VAL` in your `docker run` calls.

Being a wise bird, the Owl wants a formal description of environment variables to become an essential part of every code repository. Outside of what the Owl does, this would reap the apparent benefits of Git workflows to track the evolution of environment specs.

> ü¶â This is very important: Without the indirection of a code repository colocated `Environment Specification`, we would merely perpetuate the practice of coupling environments to humans (`.dotfiles`) or workloads (paste config into your pipelines/orchestrators). Docker decoupled app/runtime and system dependencies from machines. Let's finish the job by doing the same for Configuration and Secrets.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Golden triangle: Workload, Repo, and Environment">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a15.jpg" alt="Golden triangle: Workload, Repo, and Environment" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Whether or not leaning on `.env.example` is the best solution here is debatable. However, these files are [everywhere](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:.env.example+or+file:.env.sample&patternType=keyword&sm=0) and effectively mirror what developers are already doing. And the Owl Store is neutral to how Env Specs are inserted into the graph. Currently, the only implementation is to declare variables in `.env.example` using spec type annotations. I hope that Copilot or my future bespoke AI model can auto-complete the annotations for you. Optionally, to elevate the importance, one can rename `.env.example` to `.env.spec` to send a message that its role has been upgraded.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Anatomy of Env Spec declarations">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a16.jpg" alt="Anatomy of Env Spec declarations" />
</ImageWithCaption>

It‚Äôs not inconceivable to allow multiple ways, e.g., a CRD or an SDK, to declare ENV variables and reconcile them on Git pre-push. If ENV access from code used an Owl SDK, it‚Äôs not impossible to detect and/or generate missing spec type definitions and declarations accordingly. Better tooling, yay!

### Declare Variables Spec Types via Annotations in `.env.example`

The anatomy of an environment variable‚Äôs Spec type and the resulting triplet is not unusual if you are no stranger to typing. The `!` declares variables as required, which will both throw errors when unresolved and consider the variable for resolution (if they aren't `Secret` or `Password`). While not final, this is merely an implementation detail and felt suitable for demonstration purposes.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Anatomy of a single ENV var triplet">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a17.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a single ENV var triplet" />
</ImageWithCaption>

The Owl allows defining Custom Spec types which allow both grouping of atomic variables, e.g. `Redis` = `REDIS_HOST!` + `REDIS_PORT!` + `REDIS_PASSWORD`, and overlay validation on the atomic-level. E.g. making sure a variable‚Äôs value is valid `base64`, `json`, `jwt`, `fqdn`, etc. To forgo full turing-completeness (security) in validation, Golang's tag validator library and [its baked-in tag validators](https://github.com/go-playground/validator?tab=readme-ov-file#baked-in-validations) are used. Below are more ideas on how to make validations more powerful and Env Spec types shareable.

By the way, validation is not limited to "compile-time". It‚Äôs absolutely conceivable to check, e.g. a connection to a `Redis` instance, with a single click in the Owl Store UI or TUI. Effectively delivering "runtime" checks on the edge of workloads, services, and scripts. Wouldn‚Äôt that be a great feather in the better tooling cap?

<ImageWithCaption caption="Proposed CRD-style config to define custom Env Spec types">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a18.jpg" alt="Proposed CRD-style config to define custom Env Spec types" />
</ImageWithCaption>

The idea behind these environment variable declarations is simple: Once you have two (name and spec type) out of the triplet, can you find the third? The demo shows this is possible based on contexts like authentication, authorization, metadata, the runtime machine/device/cluster, etc., and running down a resolution path in its respective graph.

<ImageWithCaption caption="Demystifying validation errors">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a19.jpg" alt="Demystifying validation errors" />
</ImageWithCaption>

Needless to say, it‚Äôs powerful to have immediate feedback if a value is absent, invalid, or an error occurs, accompanied by a descriptive error message. Since the Owl Store is fully local, feedback is immediate, making it a perfect fit for an engineer's inner loop while guarding direct access to sensitive values.

## The Graph Inside Out ü¶â

At the core of the Owl Store is a GraphQL-based graph. Now, forget everything you have ever heard about GraphQL APIs, specifically the latter part. The Owl Store leverages GraphQL for its capabilities to express typed graphs, it‚Äôs got an integral type system that transcends the boundaries of language platforms with clients available in every language, and it is battle-tested.

I looked at all sorts of graph libraries, but GraphQL is the only one that checks all the boxes. I even have a rudimentary prototype of the Owl running on React‚ÄîPreact, to be precise. It just wasn't as language platform neutral, and, let's be honest, how many frontend engineers do you see writing Environment Resolution React components? I'm still not "over" using `JSX` as a configuration frontend, but even my days only have 24 hours, and again, are people going to use it?

I have to admit what ultimately pushed GraphQL over the edge for me was getting wind of the folks at Dagger pushing forward on using GraphQL for `Cloak & Dagger`. Wisdom of crowds! I had PoC‚Äôd the Owl Store in Javascript‚Äôs Apollo first but ultimately decided to implement it inside Runme‚Äôs Golang kernel. I'm not a strong Golang developer, so please apply puppy protection to my code. Copilot wrote all the error messages ü§ñ.

So, if any of what comes next makes no sense to you, that‚Äôs totally okay. I won‚Äôt stop you from using the Owl Store. We will now look behind the Owl Store's curtains for those interested in the inner workings. I will also skip how Runme gets hold of Environment Variables since the concept of a managed Env Store is integral to Runme's markdown-based notebooks and universal task runner, with or without Owl Store.

### GraphQL but no ‚ÄúData API‚Äù

Again, The Owl Store is no GraphQL API. It doesn‚Äôt even have a GraphQL endpoint to send queries to. It‚Äôs entirely air-gapped and only runs queries programmatically inside the core. Queries are exclusively generated.

Unless you work on the Owl‚Äôs core, you never have to look, write, or understand the monstrosity of a serialized query against this graph. If you care about the abstract science behind it, all you need to know is that it works like a massive map-reduce operation where a map of `key/specs`, `key/values`, and contextual information such as e.g. GCP auth state is being passed down to every node traversing a query.

The serialized queries (visually fantastic for debugging) grow infinitely to the right since nested nodes execute serially in a predictable sequence. It's just like calling what looks like "infinitely" nested Javascript callbacks. But again, there is no API for human consumption unless you are working on the core.

<ImageWithCaption caption="String-rendered Owl snapshot query">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a20.jpg" alt="String-rendered Owl snapshot query" />
</ImageWithCaption>

These queries are monstrous because I decided to err on making the Owl‚Äôs graph maximum expressive. For instance, unlike a GraphQL data API where errors usually happen "on the edges" processing data queries or mutations, the Owl store needs to represent ‚Äúunresolved values‚Äù as defined "error states" inside the graph, not as an exception of data ingress or egressing. If an error happens on the GraphQL-level, something more fundamental went wrong, very likely a bug or an unhandled edge case.

### Space + Time + Chaining

Space-time blows up the graph's size. The `key/value` and `key/spec` maps (not anywhere visible in the serialized queries; passed as GQL variables) can ingress and egress the graph to be fully de/-serialized in between. As mentioned, the Owl Store stores every mutation to ENV vars state and its metadata over time.

This is like double-entry bookkeeping, where you can "net" a snapshot at any given point in time on a timeline. This allows us to answer other questions, such as about the lifecycle of how a variable was used. For instance, if a Runme notebook cell exports a variable `export NEW_VAR=123`, the Owl Store will store a reference to the respective cell in its metadata.

The capability to egress/ingress the graph makes it possible to chain infinite operations while collapsing the graph state into a snapshot and then ingressing the snapshot into a new graph. The resulting snapshots are virtually identical, and the new graph will no longer have access to previously collapsed history and start writing its own.

A downside, which eventually needs refactoring, is that the GraphQL definitions are relatively simple when using GraphQL types (lots of `String` no `Interfaces`, etc.) and have not yet been fully modeled. It's easier to iterate on functionality before going deep on normalization. Strings are easy to de-/serialize.

<ImageWithCaption caption="String-rendered Owl resolve query">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a21.jpg" alt="String-rendered Owl resolve query" />
</ImageWithCaption>

To illustrate how egressing the graph to ingress the snapshot produced into a new graph, let's consider "resolution". Resolution is a query that runs upon constructing a new session and looks very similar to a regular snapshot with running validation twice (before and after) and a few extra nodes in between. Remember, programming the graph is a matter of rearranging its nodes in a different way that‚Äôs still valid. It's programmable.

## Query Construction & Execution

One aspect of modeling The Owl store around GraphQL fundamentals that‚Äôs been tremendously helpful is that it makes it possible to compartmentalize error state into a series of tiny steps and provide high-fidelity error message as opposed to a wholesale `bootstrap-all.sh` that will attempt to do stand up an environment but randomly exits with `error: exit 1` or something similar unhelpful. It‚Äôs what I call the AST-fication of complexity into tiny, explainable units.

Remember, no queries in the Owl Store (unless for unit tests), are hand-written. Any query is an output of "mapping and reducing" an input into an output encoding, whether it's a CRD-like YAML or a GraphQL query or GraphQL produces another GraphQL query.

<ImageWithCaption caption="DotEnv loading expressed as example string-rendered query">
    <img src="/img/blog/typed-env-vars-a22.jpg" alt="DotEnv loading expressed as query" />
</ImageWithCaption>

For instance, instead of hard-coding the sequence of how a `DotEnv` loads, why not express it in a graph where the ‚Äúclient‚Äù can easily rearrange the nodes to change its behavior? Any error can be addressed as a distinct "unit of work".

It's not unusual to have GraphQL queries return queries. I suppose what I‚Äôm describing here are the benefits of strongly-typed contracts. However, what's uniquely powerful in expressing the Owl Store's capabilities through a graph is a strikingly healthy balance between declarative abstractions and programmability. Anyways, I don't want to bore you.

## What's Next

Let us know what you think! The Owl Store is super early. It needs usage and more work to grow into its big promises. Get involved! The owl's code is [here](https://github.com/stateful/runme/tree/main/internal/owl). Let's say the code is a bit chaotic. I'm more of a creative who likes solving painful problems than a 10x Golang engineer. Pull Requests are welcome, but more than anything, please try it out!

Here are open questions that are on our minds:

- What do you like? What don't you like?
- What configuration frontends resonate? Declarative, SDKs, Queries?
- Are env spec declarations always the same across all Environments?
- Custom Env Spec type definitions are relatively new and are shoe-horned into the code. Refactor pending!
- We'd love to leverage Cuelang to define Spec types, validate them, and consider sharing via its module system
- Perhaps Cuelang can also play a role in layering overwrites commonplace in env configs?

## Get Involved

Whoa, that was a lot.
