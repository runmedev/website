At Runme, we've been hard at work to enhance your experience and bring you some thrilling new features to upgrade your documentation automation process. We're excited to share these updates with you.

## **What's New at Runme?**

### 1. Record Every Change in Your Cloud Infrastructure:

Managing changes and updates in the cloud infrastructure deployment process can be challenging.

Through the auto-save feature, we are providing a simple and effective way to track inputs and activities during deployment. This ensures you have a detailed record of all outputs and changes made to your cloud infrastructure, enhancing task management and providing a consistent way to run automated processes.

Whether you're dealing with constant changes in CI/CD pipelines or facing challenges in maintaining automation, Runme has you covered.

### 2. Get a Copy of Your Saved Outputs with Session Outputs:

Keep a comprehensive record of your work effortlessly. With auto-save enabled, Runme automatically saves a complete copy of the original Markdown document, including all cell outputs generated during the notebook's execution using "[Runme Session Outputs](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/auto-save#session-outputs)."

      className="rounded"
      autoPlay
      loop

      <source src="/img/blog/whats-new-in-runme-v3-a1.jpg" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>
> Session Outputs in action

### **3. View Generated Outputs as Modified Files:**

Running cells and generating output in the notebook editor will now be recognized as a change, marking the document as modified. While this typically does not impact the source file, the session outputs file gets updated with the latest information.

### **4. Improved Usability with Annotation Configuration Options:**

Our Configure foldout has undergone a revamp! Annotation configuration options are now arranged based on their frequency of use, enhancing usability for a smoother experience.

### **5. Name Cells in Your Notebook:**

In our latest release, we've introduced an exciting upgrade to your Runme experience. You can now name your cells directly on the notebook! This means Runme cells can now have specific names, making it easier to find and run specific cells. Check out the [Named Cell](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/cell-level#unnamed-vs-named-cells) section of the Runme docs for more information.
