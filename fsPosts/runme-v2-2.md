We understand that every interaction with interactive runbooks is a unique journey. Running cells in the runbooks out of sequence or re-running a few of them multiple times is not unusual. With that in mind, we've now added a counter right next to cells to display in what order a cell was run. Simple yet powerful as shown in the following video:

</video>

A more detailed breakdown of what fixes and features made it into Runme v2.2 release is available in the [changelog](https://github.com/stateful/vscode-runme/releases/tag/2.2.0) or [read the docs](https://docs.runme.dev/) to learn more.

But, there's more...

# Runme v3.0 - A Sneak Preview

Runme v3 is just around the corner. We're working on putting the final touches on the User Experience before shipping it soon. Watch the video below to learn about v3's signature feature, `Session Outputs`. For the first time since Runme's inception `Session Outputs` will allow to capture cell outputs inside a full copy of the original markdown file, which won't just contain the input cells but results produced during a notebook session.

    <source src="/img/blog/runme-v2-2-a6.jpg" type="video/webm" />
</video>
> Available in the upcoming Runme v3.0 release

The original markdown file used to load the Runme notebook will be left intact and thus generic for easy sharing with your team inside, e.g., a git repository. Stay tuned for Runme v3's release blog post soon.
