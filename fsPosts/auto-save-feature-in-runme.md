Because something always breaks, reliably and efficiently safeguarding your work is essential. About 10 years ago, I lost some really important work because the tool I was working on didn’t have `auto-save` (which can be quite a common story). The Auto-Save feature in Runme doesn’t just safeguard your work, providing a seamless and hassle-free way to ensure that your work is continuously saved to the Runme Playground; it’s also super handy for getting a teammate involved in troubleshooting. In this blog post, we'll look into the wonders of the Auto-Save feature, exploring how to enable it and highlighting its storage and accessibility benefits.

## How to Enable Auto-Save

Enabling the Auto-Save feature in Runme’s VS Code extension is straightforward. Here’s how:

1. **Toggle Auto-Save On/Off:**
   By default, the Auto-save feature is off. A simple toggle switch at the top of your Markdown (.md) file lets you quickly turn Auto-Save on or off and adapt the part to your specific workflow requirements.

<br />

2. **Activate Auto-Save by default:**
   - **Access Extension Settings:**
     Begin by navigating to the Runme extension settings in VS Code. This is typically located in the toolbar or under a settings menu. The settings serve as the control center for customizing your Runme experience.
   - **Make Auto-Save Your Default:**
     Within the settings, locate the Auto-Save option. Click on "Yes" to enable the feature. This action configures the system to automatically save the output of each cell execution, eliminating the need for manual saving and providing a safety net for your valuable work.

## Storage and Collaboration

The Auto-Save feature in Runme does not just ensure the continuous preservation of your day’s work; it takes storage, security, and collaboration to the next level.

1. **End-to-end Encrypted Cloud Storage:**
   All auto-saved content is securely stored in a dedicated cell on the Runme Playground. This means your data is saved in real-time and accessible from any location, as long as you are strongly authenticated and have internet access. This cloud-based storage solution is conveniently fast while being end-to-end encrypted using military-grade ciphers.
2. **Collaboration for Your Teams:**
   The Auto-Save feature is also designed with team collaboration in mind. It allows for seamless sharing if owners explicitly choose to provide access to team members, ensuring everyone is on the same page, tremendously lowering the bar for troubleshooting. With Auto-Save, teams can unblock each other on tasks and workflows. Let’s be real; something almost always breaks, and high-fidelity contextual information is essential for swift resolution.
